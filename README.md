# RecPlayer-iOS
A simple iOS application that records audio and plays it back. (+some animations)

This project was made to test a specific behaviour of AudioKit's AKMicrophone. This version uses a custom AVFoundation microphone instead of AKMicrophone. It does use AudioKit for the second audio plot you see in the demo.png . I'll upload a different project with an AKMicrophone and link it here for behaviour comparison. (Mainly the red recording bar that remains when the app is running in the background).
